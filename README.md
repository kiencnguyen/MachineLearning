## Course Information:
The goal of Machine Learning is to build computer systems that can adapt and learn from data. In this course we will cover three main areas: 

1. **Discriminative models**
1. **Generative models**
1. **Reinforcement learning models**

In particular we will cover the following: 

- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression
- Support Vector Machines
- Deep Nets
- Structured Methods
- Learning Theory
- kMeans
- Gaussian Mixtures
- Expectation Maximization
- Markov Decision Processes
- Q-Learning

## Pre-requisites: 
Probability, Linear Algebra, and proficiency in Python.

## [Additional Resources](Resources)

### [Machine Learning Algorithms](Resources/ML_Algorithms)

A collection of minimal and clean implementations of machine learning algorithms. This project is targeting people who want to learn internals of ml algorithms or implement them from scratch.
The code is much easier to follow than the optimized libraries and easier to play with.
All algorithms are implemented in Python, using numpy, scipy and autograd.

### [Naive CNN](Resources/NaiveCNN)

A very basic numpy implementation of CNN.

### [Adversarial Nets](Resources/adversarial-mnist)

Notebook for naive implementation of Adversarial Neural Network.
