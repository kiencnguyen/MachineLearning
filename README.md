This project contains simple and naive machine learning techniques. The lecture slides and assignments are from [CS446 UIUC Spring 2018](https://courses.engr.illinois.edu/cs446/sp2018/_site/).

## [Resources](Resources)

Additional material besides coursework

### [Machine Learning Algorithms](Resources/ML_Algorithms)

A collection of minimal and clean implementations of machine learning algorithms. This project is targeting people who want to learn internals of ml algorithms or implement them from scratch.
The code is much easier to follow than the optimized libraries and easier to play with.
All algorithms are implemented in Python, using numpy, scipy and autograd.

### [Naive CNN](Resources/NaiveCNN)

A very basic numpy implementation of CNN.

### [Adversarial Nets](Resources/adversarial-mnist)

Notebook for naive implementation of Adversarial Neural Network.
